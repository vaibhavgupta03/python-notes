# String Methods and Indexing in Python

## Introduction
Strings in Python are sequences of characters that are used to store and manipulate text. Python provides a variety of built-in methods to perform operations on strings, making it easier to work with text data. This chapter will cover some common string methods and the concept of indexing.

## String Methods
String methods are functions that can be called on string objects to perform specific operations. Here are some commonly used string methods:

### 1. `lower()`
The `lower()` method converts all characters in a string to lowercase.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.lower())  # Output: vaibhav gupta
```

### 2. `upper()`
The `upper()` method converts all characters in a string to uppercase.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.upper())  # Output: VAIBHAV GUPTA
```

### 3. `title()`
The `title()` method converts the first character of each word to uppercase.
**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.title())  # Output: Vaibhav Gupta
```

### 4. `strip()`
The `strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
```python
name = "   Vaibhav Gupta   "
print(name.strip())  # Output: Vaibhav Gupta

```

### 5. `replace()`
The `replace()` method replaces a specified substring with another substring.
**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.replace("Vaibhav", "Priyanshu"))  # Output: Priyanshu Gupta

```

### 6. `find()`
The `find()` method returns the lowest index of the substring if found in the string. If not found, it returns -1.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.find("Gupta"))  # Output: 8
print(name.find("Python"))  # Output: -1
```

### 7. `count()`
The `count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the string.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name.count("a"))  # Output: 3

```

## String Indexing
Indexing is used to access individual characters in a string. In Python, string indexing starts at 0. You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string.

### Accessing Characters
**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav"
print(name[0])  # Output: V
print(name[1])  # Output: a
print(name[-1])  # Output: v (last character)
```

### Slicing Strings
You can slice strings to obtain a substring by specifying a start and end index.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name[0:5])  # Output: Vaibh
print(name[6:])   # Output: av Gupta
print(name[:5])   # Output: Vaibh
print(name[-5:])  # Output: Gupta
```

### Step in Slicing
You can also specify a step in slicing to skip characters.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Vaibhav Gupta"
print(name[::2])  # Output: VibhGta
print(name[::-1]) # Output: atpuG vahbiV (reversed string)
```

## Conclusion
Understanding string methods and indexing is essential for effective text manipulation in Python. These tools allow you to format, search, and modify strings easily, making them a fundamental part of programming in Python.
